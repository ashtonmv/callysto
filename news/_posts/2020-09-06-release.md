title: pyiron 0.3 released
---
We are excited to announce the release of pyiron 0.3! Here's some of what's new:
<ul>
    <li>
        The <code class="inline">Atoms</code> class is now derived from the ASE atoms class
    </li>
    <li>
        Remote HPC clusters without a local database can be accessed via SSH.
    </li>
    <li>
        SPHInX is the first simulation code to use the newly introduced InputList class which supersedes the <code class="inline">GenericParameters</code> class and adds support for hierarchical input structures within a single instance of the class.
    </li>
</ul>
Besides these new features many bugs were fixed to improve the stability of the code. Still, as core components of pyiron changed with this release, we suggest caution when updating. Bug fixes are going to be distributed as 0.3.X.
